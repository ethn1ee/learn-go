## To Learn

1. basics: static typing, for loop, slice, string, map
2. packaging (export with uppercase)
3. struct
4. pointer
5. receiver (value receiver vs pointer receiver); go has no class
6. concurrency (goroutine, channel, waitgroup)

## To Make

We can build a text analyer that can:
- count the total number of words
- count the total number of unique words
- find the top 5 most frequent words
